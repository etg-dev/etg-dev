### My Programming Philosophies

1. **Make the code work.**
2. **Optimize for efficiency.** Ensure the code runs as quickly as possible with minimal resource allocation.
3. **Avoid panic in third-party packages.** Always pass errors and let users or developers decide how to handle them.
4. **Favor the standard library.** Use standard library functions whenever possible to minimize external dependencies.
5. **Thoroughly vet third-party libraries.** Only use third-party packages if necessary, and ensure they are reliable and well-maintained.
6. **Write precise tests.** Create tests that are specific in scope and avoid unnecessary conditions.
7. **Document comprehensively.** Clear and thorough documentation is essential, even if it is not always enjoyable to write.
8. **Commit to continuous learning.** Always seek to deepen your understanding and stay updated with best practices and new developments.
